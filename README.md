This is the README file for the Global Engineering Artifact Project.  
All information about this project is contained in the document "Artifact Proposal.docx" in the Project Proposals folder.
"Help! It Is Not Working.txt" contains useful information about resolving potential issues with the artifact project.
These file are meant to be edited with the Unity3D game engine (https://unity3d.com/).

To work on this project:
  1) Pull the entire project to your local repository with Git
  2) Open the "Artifact Project" folder in Unity3D
  3) Make changes and add functionality
  4) When you are finished working, save and close Unity3D
  5) In Git, add all new or modified files to your local repository
  6) In Git, commit all changes to your local repository

Notes:
  Try to keep file sizes below 50MB or GitHub will complain.  This can happen with the metadata file for uncompressed
      textures.
  At the moment (5-20-15) the repository is about 400 MB, so keep that in mind when downloading (pulling) to your
      local repository.
