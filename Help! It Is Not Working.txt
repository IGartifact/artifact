Here are some ways to resolve poential issues with the artifact project

//---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem Location: Missing software and drivers
Potential Issues:
	Cannot find or open prefab models (like the GPS satellite model)
	Cannot communicate with GPS receiver (nothing detected on ANY USB port even though the GPS receiver is plugged in)
Potential Resolution:
	Are all of the necessary software and drivers installed?
	To edit that artifact project, the following is necessary.
		Unity3D version 5 or higher with MonoDevelop version 4 or higher (https://unity3d.com/ - the free version is fine)
		Blender 2.74 or higher (https://www.blender.org/)
		BU-353-S4 GPS receiver driver (http://usglobalsat.com/s-172-bu-353-s4-support.aspx)

Problem Location: Astron GPS Viewer
Potential Issues:
	The computer cannot connect to the GPS receiver, or the communication port cannot be opened.
	The error "IOException: Access is denied." is thrown.
	The wrong communication port is opened.
Potential Resolution:
	First, make sure the driver for the USB GPS receiver is properly installed and the GPS receiver is connected to the computer through 
	a USB port.  If that does not resolve the issue, open GPS_Control.cs, and manually set the COM port in the void Start() function 
	around line 32.  Here is how to do that.

	The current code automatically locates and sets the COM port.  If the error "IOException: Access is denied." is thrown, then this 
	issue is probably here.  You can comment out the original code in void Start() and manually set the COM port by replacing it with 
	the following line:
								
		public SerialPort com_port = new SerialPort("XXXX", 9600)
		
	where XXXX is the name of the COM port (ex: COM1, COM2, COM3, COM4).  To determine the correct COM port in Windows, open the 
	Device Manager and expand the Ports(COM & LPT) section.  The serial devices are listed with their associated COM port.  The COM 
	port number for a device is different for EVERY computer.

Problem Location: Multiple locations
Potential Issues:
	The displayed information does not fit the screen.
	The Weather Tab in the RSS Scene is not visible.
	A pink background appears around the edges of some screens.
	The calendar in the Calendar Scene does not fill the screen.
Potential Resolution:
	The bulk of the artifact project was designed on other computers, because the artifact computer and projector was not purchased yet.
	It is difficult to design a screen layout when you do not know the final screen size that will be displayed on the wall.

	All display issues will need to be corrected in code or within Unity.  Once the artifact computer and projector are set up, the 
	displayed content will need to be optimized for the projected screen.  This will probably require trial and error testing to make it
	look good.  In addition to the layout, colors and fonts may need to be adjusted as well.
