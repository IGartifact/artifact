Bugs within the artifact project:

Fezzik might crash on occasion.
When internet is disconnected it begins snowing and squares begin to fall
Errors and warnings still show up that appear to have no effect but are annoying (might be able to use #pragma)
It is raining outside and the weather app still says clear (but shows a clear background)
The Project Timeline section the the Artifact Proposal document needs to be updates with the current project schedule.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cleanup:

Optimize the layout, font, and colors for the projected screen once the projector is set up.
Aesthetic Rework (Async Scenes, GUI Controlled Overlays, Conquistador Scene)
Darwin's script cleanup (Bring Branch up to changes)
Getting someone else to work on the project (Why do I even bother?)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Necessary Features:

<<<<<<< HEAD
Campus Map
Calendar Fillout
News Application
Weather Application
Kinect SDK
=======
Campus Map - Requires Darwin
News Application - Requires Diane Approval
Weather Application - Requires Darwin
Kinect SDK - Requires Rhett
>>>>>>> New_Master

Ideas:
<<<<<<< HEAD
Galaxy Scene dedicated to stars positions and visualization (Demo Works)
Country Info for discovering basic facts about our world and the cultures within it
Upgrades for Fezzik allowing Internet access (Demo Works)
At least ten simplistic games(Pong, Maze, Chess)
Global Run
Sandbox Simulation, a voxel-based game for construction (Demo Works)
ASync scene display on Main Page (Demo Works)
Construction of the Conquistador

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
=======
Galaxy Scene dedicated to stars positions and visualization.
-New Data
-Camera control complete with focusing

-3D Tetris?

Global Run(Temple Run around the world)
-Lots of models
-Path algorithm
-Animation for main player

Sandbox Simulation, a voxel-based game for construction

-LOD
-Procedural Mesh Generation
-Literally the entire game

Scene within a scene display on main page
-Sketch out plans 
-Model of the window and floors
-Blur Atmosphere
-Correct click controls
-futuristic UI

Construction of the Conquistador
-A lot of modeling and planning
-Armillary

Fezzik Update to get him to use the APIs
-More APIs
-Library of questions that lead to APIs
-RTD Bus Info to be save as xml for parsing by Fezzik

Paint
