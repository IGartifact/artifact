Bug Report for Unity Project: Artifact_UFO_Survival
03 29 2016

1. Null Reference Exception on play
***
Object reference not set to an instance of an object
ScoreManager.Update () (at C:/Users/georg_000/Documents/UnityProjects/UFO_Survival/Assets/Scripts/ScoreManager.cs:20)
***
-- Consider rewriting ScoreManager.cs, Ssme scripts are repetitive and unnessicary.

2. Laser fires in the wrong place when mouse clicks are faster than .5 seconds apart.
-- This may not be an issue with the touch screen implementation/usage.
